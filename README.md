### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn # npm i
```

### 2. Run Development Environment

yarn dev # npm run dev

### Test Production Environment

I also included a `stage` script that will build and start a production server. You can run it with:

```bash
yarn stage # npm run stage
```

Alternatively you can run:

```bash
yarn build # npm run build
yarn start # npm start
